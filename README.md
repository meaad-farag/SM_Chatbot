 # Framework and background development language :
  
 - we choose flask as a framework since flask is best for small apps that could get big quickly.
  
 - We decide to choosing python for backend development, Having many advantages from the ease
   of learning to a large number of frameworks that simplify the development process, Python 
   is often used for backend web application development. In addition, Python is well-equipped
   to work with analytics, calculations, AI and ML, and statistics.

  # Chatbot :
  
 - While there are many chatbots available, we decided to use Mobile Monkey as an Instagram chatbot
   for its unique features.
 - MobileMonkey is the first OmniChat tool on the web. It allows companies to interact in real time with 
   their users. In fact, it is one of the Instagram chatbots that is quite famous on this platform.  
 - With MobileMonkey, you can take advantage of features like the cross-platform chatbot generator.
   The latter allows you to reuse chat marketing content regardless of the chat platform.
 - You can also use a merged chat inbox that makes it easy to manage all conversations (inbound and outbound)
   in a single space.
 - Finally, you can use an automation and integration toolkit. This allows you to improve your
   marketing communications.
